# K Control Flow Graph (KCFG)

Refer to [K Control Flow Graph (KCFG)](http://127.0.0.1:5000/s/T2KVb4tqbNdAsPxsEyPQ/kevm-foundry-integration-example/k-control-flow-graph-kcfg "mention") in the [KEVM Integration for Foundry](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/MwuC1PgHx91Qm96rVCnq/s/T2KVb4tqbNdAsPxsEyPQ/ "mention") for a detailed explanation on reading the **KCFG (K Control Graph).**

To launch the **KCFG (K Control Graph)** for KEVM use the command:&#x20;

```
kevm view-kcfg ...
```

Instead of `kevm foundry-view-kcfg ...` as you will see in the Foundry integration docs.
